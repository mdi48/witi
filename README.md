# WITI (Why Is This Installed?)
A simple cli tool to give you information regarding the installation status of a given package. It will
tell you if it was installed explicitly, or as a result of another package. It will also list what the package's dependencies and which installed packages require it.

This is just a simple tool I made as a project to help me learn Go, and is intended for my own personal use (at least for now), and only supports the pacman package manager as a result (again, this might change in future.)

Also, shoutout to [witr](https://github.com/pranshuparmar/witr) for the name inspiration. It's a fantastic tool that I have found incredibly helpful.
